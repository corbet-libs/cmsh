//! P2P transport facade.
//!
//! `cmsh` offers one transport interface to the member side (`cmsg`, the vault's
//! "send to my device" port, `cdht` through the DHT capability) over network
//! leaves that implement [`cmsh_api::Backend`] (`cvln` for Veilid, `ctrn` for
//! Tor):
//!
//! - listen and dial by abstract [`Address`] (scheme + bytes);
//! - reliable streams, multiplexed once here with `yamux` ([`Connection`],
//!   [`Substream`]) and framed with `tokio-util`'s length-delimited codec
//!   ([`frame`]);
//! - declared [`Capabilities`], surfaced per backend ([`Mesh::status`]) and in
//!   combination ([`Mesh::offered`]);
//! - a connection [`Policy`] (default: anonymous only) plus the operator's
//!   minimum standard, executed by `cfbk`: nothing below either is ever used,
//!   and every switch is recorded ([`Mesh::take_switches`]);
//! - optional datagrams ([`Mesh::datagrams`]) and the DHT capability hook
//!   ([`Mesh::dht`]) where a backend offers them.
//!
//! The facade is runtime-agnostic: background futures (session drivers,
//! listener pumps) go to the embedding runtime through [`Spawn`].
